## Packages that Simplify Functions

**mosaic**
- Offers a set of commands to simplify data visualization, numerical summaries, statistical methods, and more with uniform code based on the template for linear models in R.

Ref: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/index.html


**lessR**
- Seeks to simplify R code with functions that do the work of multiple base R functions, including those pertaining summary statistics, modeling, data visualization, and more.

Ref: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lessR/index.html


**MobilizeSimple**

- Strives to simplify complicated functions like mapmaking, text clouds, and more to help high school curriculum. Available on Github.
